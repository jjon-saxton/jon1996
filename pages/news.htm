<h1 class="title">Site News and Weblog</h1>
<p>
In the mid to late 1990&rsquo;s, there was a new type of website that popped up. These sites were dedicated to people&rsquo;s opinions or news. We called them weblogs, but this wasn&rsquo;t eventually shortened to just blog. In the modern age, these have largely be replaced by macro-blogs like Twitter or social sites like Facebook, but, before then, the blog was the way to put your opinions out there. Here, I will be putting a my own thoughts about various topics, but this will remain mostly a place for site news.
