    <h1>A Test Page</h1>
    <p>Hello all you awesome people!</p>
    <p>This rad page collects some old skool HTML tags and stuff. It is designed to showcase what you could do with HTML back around 1996, the year I had started to learn how to build web sites. Right now it is blank, except this text, as I have to remember some of this stuff. Soon I hope it will be full of awesome stuff though!</p>
