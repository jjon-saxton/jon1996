<h1 class="title">BBSs and Forums</h1>
<p>
I may have mentioned that <a href="./search.htm">Search Engines</a> used to be the way people got around the internet back when the World Wide Web was new, but, what if I told you there was something that existed <i>before</i> the World Wide Web was even a twinkle in someone&rsquo;s eyes? Back in 1978, as the story goes, during a particularly bad Chicago blizzard, Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, wanted a way to keep up with their computer club. The aforementioned blizzard reminded them that it wouldn&rsquo;t always be possible to get together in person, so, they did what any computer enthusiast would do (at least that&rsquo;s what I think). They found a way to keep up with each other using computers! This resulted in software called CBBS, which allowed owners of personal computers with a modem to dial in to a designated system and leave messages for other users to read. You can think of this as the digital equivalent of a push-pin bulletin board that one might have seen (and maybe even still see) at the local community center.
</p>

<p>
In a way the BBS was social media <i>before</i> social media, or even before the internet as we know it. I just barely missed out on this trend. While many recount the mid 1990&rsquo;s (1995-1996, in particular) as the peak of the BBS, I, either due to my age or general lack of exposure, didn&rsquo;t see any, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t post on any. However, I <i>did</i> experience something similar that was, in my opinion, an attempt to take the BBS into the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; era of the World Wide Web. These system, colloquially referred to as forums, would be the backbone of my communication until my late high school days when SMMS and social media would start to take over. I did use instant messaging as well, but how do you think I found those people? That&rsquo;s right, forums!

Now forums still exist for some niche communities, in fact I run a small <a href="https://forums.onigirionegai.info/">forum</a>* myself (which, though it does have a theme designed to emulate the <i>look</i> of a BBS, cannot run on vintage systems due to modern security protocols), but they are certainly not as popular as they once were. I actually think this is a bit of a shame. Both BBS and forums fostered much more tightly nit communities than social media does. Sure, there were still trolls, in fact I would bet they were originally bred by BBSs, but they could be quickly rooted out by merit of a smaller community and much more dedicated administrators or SysOps.
</p>

<p>
Discord servers or Matrix chat rooms are the closest thing we have to this experience today, but, at the end of the day Discord is owned and operated by a company and Matrix is often still a bit too niche. There is nothing quite like finding just the right forum, one with the right combination of people that are almost just like you. I remember spending hours browsing, debating, or even role-playing on forums back in the day. Maybe people would see that as a waste of time today, but it was really fun for me, almost more fun than playing a computer game.

<h2 id="org0cf6f9f">Can you still experience this today?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0cf6f9f">
<p>
The short answer is yes, but the long answer is a bit more nuanced. First, as I mentioned, there are still forums being operated today, including those run by private individuals, <a href="http://forums.onigirionegai.info/">insert my second plug</a>*, but they are often missing the size of community or they are too large and difficult to manage. There are also ways to use telnet (did you know many GNU/Linux distributions still ship that?) to access old BBSs. The old boards and, even old messages in some cases, are still there, but the community, that&rsquo;s hard to replicate.
</p>

<p>
So, while you certainly <i>can</i> see what it was like to browse a forum or see how BBSs looked and operated back in the day, can you really experience what it was like to communicate on these systems back in the day? In their true spirit I would say that experience is lost to time. <b>Both</b> BBSs and forums were about more than reaching out, they were about their communities. These are far more difficult to replicate today. Nevertheless, you can still get a part of it. If you&rsquo;re on Linux try typing <code>telnet</code> into a terminal emulator. Once there try:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">telnet&gt;open cavebbs.homeip.net
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Follow some on-screen instructions to create a new user and have a look around. I&rsquo;ll try to come up with a list of other BBSs you can also check out. If you&rsquo;re not on Linux, try searching for a telnet terminal emulator for your chosen operating system. I&rsquo;ll list a few of those as well in the future. If you want, you can also check out the forums I linked <b>twice</b> already.

I have done my best to ensure that this BBS systems are still operating and browsable today. However, due to the nature of this particular niche I cannot ensure they will always be available! The address in parenthesis is what you would type into telnet on a Linux machine, other systems may require a colon &ldquo;:&rdquo; instead of a space between addresses and port numbers. Clicking the name should also open a telnet terminal to the right site if you have a dedicated telnet terminal installed and your browser is configured correctly.

The following is <b>not</b> an extensive list of forums, but a <b>curated</b> list. I have vetted these to ensure that they are likely to stick around and, as most of you visiting this site are likely interested in similar things, they will be centered around vintage hardware, software, and/or gaming. Please also be aware than many of these will not open on a vintage browser. I will do the opposite of normal. Any forums that <b>DO</b> open I will mark with a plus &ldquo;+&rdquo;.
