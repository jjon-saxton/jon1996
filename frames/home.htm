    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This site exists for one reason, because I want it to! Honestly though, in around 1996 I was introduced to the world of website design while attempting to earn a computer merit page in boy scouts. We used an HTML generator of some kind, and no it was not Dreamweaver, to build websites, which I thought was really cool. Unfortunately, the software was on one of the scout leader's laptops so, though I did have the files for the website, I was not able to make any changes using the editing tools. This meant I had to learn HTML if I wanted to update my site! So, I just gave up and never touched it again... just kidding ;) Of course I learned HTML!</p>
    <h2>1997-2000</h2>
    <p>Throughout the late 90's I learned as much as I can about HTML and began to design a fansite, actually the original site I was working on was a Star Trek site, but I worked on other sites that I would host on geocities and other free hosting platforms.</p>
    <p>HTML was great, but I quickly learned there was more that could be done with JavaScript. I began to pick that up next. In keeping with the spirit of the era, and where I was during that time, no JavaScript is used on <i>this</i> page or the navigation bar, but the <a href="../pages/test.htm">test page</a> (linked in the navigation bar) doesn't have that limitation, neither will any of the other pages. I continue to have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript to this day >:D</p>
    <h2>2000</h2>
    <p>Free hosts were great, but they were limited. You could host static HTML pages with a little JavaScript. Aside from some tools that were freely available by the host or on other sites, such as forums (BBS) and guest books, there wasn't much you could do. I did find a host that would let me host Perl applications that I wrote and this began my studies of server-side programming languages. I worked on a dynamic image gallery in Perl, but didn't really touch anything involving user input for quite sometime. This was mostly because Perl was a general-purpose scripting language and was not built for handling things like form inputs, for example. It did get me started though ;)</p>
    <h2>2001-2005</h2>
    <p>I continued building fansites, including a rather large Sailormoon site with a huge image gallery as well as Cardcaptor Sakura site. In fact, this was the year I undertook a rather large undertaking that I would eventually call SakuraNET, which was a huge CCS fansite.</p>
    <p>While building SakuraNET was not happy with the limitations of Perl and began looking for something better suited for web application development and handling user input from websites. Enter PHP! I scrapped everything written in Pearl and re-wrote everything using PHP and never looked back!</p>
    <h2>2007-2012</h2>
    <p>This is where I went to college. I didn't get a degree in software engineering or even web-design. My education is all Psychology, but I <i>did</i> continue working on websites, in fact, I managed to get a job working for the Math and Science Teaching Institute at UNC where I honed PHP, HTML, AJAX, and MySQL skills. This included developing a content management system that used a MySQL database to manage pages and users. Unfortunately, this also marked the end of any attempts to finish SakuraNET or any of my fansites.</p>
    <h2>2012-present</h2>
    <p>I continue to hone my skills and keep up-to-date on the latest website management and construciton tools and techniques, I even host a few modern sites. You can view these sites at <a href="http://onigirionegai.info/~jon" target="_parent">my other playground</a>, just don't use an old browser for that!</p>
